# THE 44 AXIOMS OF JOSEPH SUGARMAN
*The foundation of the "Persuasion Flow" skill.*

## Section 1: Understanding the Process

**Axiom 1:** Copywriting is a mental process the successful execution of which reflects the sum total of all your experiences, your specific knowledge and your ability to mentally process that information and transfer it onto a sheet of paper for the purpose of selling a product or service.

**Axiom 2:** All the elements in an advertisement are primarily designed to do one thing and one thing only: get you to read the first sentence of the copy.

**Axiom 3:** The sole purpose of the first sentence in an advertisement is to get you to read the second sentence.

**Axiom 4:** Your layout and the first few paragraphs of your ad must create the buying environment most conducive to the sale of your product or service.

**Axiom 5:** Get the reader to say yes and harmonize with your accurate and truthful statements while reading your copy. / Get the reader to nod in agreement.

**Axiom 6:** Your readers should be so compelled to read your copy that they cannot stop reading until they read all of it as if sliding down a slippery slide.

**Axiom 7:** When trying to solve a problem, don't assume constraints that aren't there.

**Axiom 8:** Keep the copy interesting and the reader interested through the power of curiosity.

**Axiom 9:** Never sell a product or service. Always sell a concept.

**Axiom 10:** The incubation process is the power of your subconscious mind to use all your knowledge and experiences to solve a specific problem, and its efficiency is dictated by time, creative orientation, the environment and your ego.

**Axiom 11:** Copy should be long enough to cause the reader to take the action you request.

**Axiom 12:** Every communication should be a personal one, from the writer to the recipient, regardless of the medium used.

**Axiom 13:** The ideas presented in your copy should flow in a logical fashion, anticipating your prospect's questions and answering them as if the questions were asked face-to-face.

**Axiom 14:** In the editing process, you refine your copy to express exactly what you want to express with the fewest words.

## Section 2: Understanding What Works

**Axiom 15:** The more effortless the buying process, the more sales you will make.

**Axiom 16:** Specifics stay with you; generalities roll off you like water off a duck's back. / You sell on emotion, but you justify a purchase with logic.

**Axiom 17:** Honest copy is clearer, more credible, and sells better.

**Axiom 18:** If the reader thinks they are being sold, they will resist. If they think they are being informed or entertained, they will lower their defenses.

## Section 3: Psychological Triggers (The Big Ones)

**Axiom 19 (Feeling of Involvement):** Creating a feeling of involvement or ownership makes it difficult for the consumer to let go of the product.

**Axiom 20 (Honesty):** Acknowledging a flaw or a negative aspect of your offer can increase credibility and trust.

**Axiom 21 (Integrity):** Your copy must convey integrity. It must be believable.

**Axiom 22 (Credibility):** Credibility comes from being an expert, being honest, and being specific.

**Axiom 23 (Value and Proof of Value):** You must prove the value of your offer is greater than the price you are asking.

**Axiom 24 (Justify the Purchase):** Give the customer a logical reason (an excuse) to buy what they emotionally want.

**Axiom 25 (Greed):** Greed is a powerful motivator, but it must be handled carefully. (Often disguised as "Bargain Hunting").

**Axiom 26 (Authority):** People respect authority. Use it.

**Axiom 27 (Satisfaction Conviction):** A guarantee is not enough. You must convince the prospect that they will be satisfied.

**Axiom 28 (Nature of Product):** Every product has a unique personality and nature. You must find it and relate to it.

**Axiom 30 (Timing):** Being in the right place at the right time with the right offer is crucial.

## Section 4: Advanced Concepts

**Axiom 31:** Don't just sell the cure, sell the prevention (or vice-versa depending on the market). Sometimes selling the "cure" is more powerful.

**Axiom 36:** You must become an expert on the product and the customer.

**Axiom 37:** Practice is the only way to master the skill of copywriting.

**Axiom 38:** Graphics and layout should complement the copy, not compete with it.

**Axiom 39:** The headline must be powerful enough to force the reader to read the subheadline.

**Axiom 40:** The subheadline must be powerful enough to force the reader to read the first sentence.

**Axiom 41:** Sell the benefits, not just the features.

**Axiom 42:** Ask for the order. Tell the reader exactly what to do.

**Axiom 43:** Make it easy to order.

**Axiom 44:** Test everything. Your opinion doesn't matter; the market's response does.
