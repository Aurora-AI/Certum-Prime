About the Authors
-----------------

[Patricio Gonzalez Vivo](http://patriciogonzalezvivo.com/) (1982, Buenos Aires, Argentina) is a New York based artist and developer. He explores interstitial spaces between organic and synthetic, analog and digital, individual and collective. In his work he uses code as an expressive language with the intention of developing a better together.

Patricio studied and practiced psychotherapy and expressive art therapy. He holds an MFA in Design & Technology from Parsons The New School, where he now teaches. Currently he works as a Graphic Engineer at Mapzen making openSource mapping tools.

[Jen Lowe](http://jenlowe.net/) is an independent data scientist and data communicator at Datatelling where she brings together people + numbers + words. She teaches in SVA's Design for Social Innovation program, cofounded the School for Poetic Computation, taught Math for Artists at NYU ITP, researched at the Spatial Information Design Lab at Columbia University, and contributed ideas at the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. She's spoken at SXSW and Eyeo. Her work has been covered by The New York Times and Fast Company. Her research, writing, and speaking explore the promises and implications of data and technology in society. She has a B.S. in Applied Math and a Master's in Information Science. Often oppositional, she's always on the side of love.
