GSAP Overview
The Core contains
everything
you need to create blazingly fast, responsive animations for all browsers. Additional capabilities, like
Dragging
,
Scroll Animation
or
Morphing
are tucked away in plugins. This allows the core to remain relatively small and lets you add features only when you need them.
