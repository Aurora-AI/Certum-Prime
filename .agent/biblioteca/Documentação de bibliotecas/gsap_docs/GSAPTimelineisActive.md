methods
.isActive()
On this page
isActive
isActive
( ) : Boolean
Indicates whether or not the animation is currently active (meaning the virtual playhead is actively moving across this instance's time span and it is not paused, nor are any of its ancestor timelines).
Returns : Boolean
â
Returns a Boolean that indicates whether or not the timeline is currently active.
Details
â
Indicates whether or not the animation is currently active (meaning the virtual playhead is actively moving across this instance's time span and it is not paused, nor are any of its ancestor timelines). So for example, if a timeline is in the middle of animating, it's active, but after it is finished (or before it begins), it is
not
active. If it is paused or if it is placed inside of a timeline that's paused (or if any of its ancestor timelines are paused),
isActive()
will return
false
. If the playhead is directly on top of the animation's start time (even if it hasn't rendered quite yet), that counts as "active".
You may also check the
timeline.progress()
or
timeline.totalProgress()
, but those don't take into consideration the paused state or the position of the parent timeline's playhead. The global timeline is always considered active.
In the demo below we use
isActive()
to make sure the tween can not have its direction changed while it is active. Click the
toggle tween direction
button repeatedly to see that clicks are ignored while the box is moving.
