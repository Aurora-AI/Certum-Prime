Observer
properties
.isEnabled
On this page
isEnabled
isEnabled
: Boolean
Indicates whether or not the Observer is enabled. Use the
enable()
and
disable()
methods to set the state. When an Observer is disabled, it removes all of its event listeners from the target and obviously won't trigger any callbacks. There are
onEnable
and
onDisable
callbacks, though, which of course would be called when you enable/disable the Observer.
