Draggable
properties
.endX
On this page
endX
endX
: Number
[read-only] The ending x (horizontal) position of the Draggable instance which is calculated as soon as the mouse/touch is released after a drag, meaning you can use it to predict precisely where it'll land after an
inertia
flick.

Number
- The ending
x
(horizontal) position of the Draggable instance.
endX
gets populated immediately when the mouse (or touch) is released after dragging, even before tweening has completed. This makes it easy to predict exactly where the element will land (useful for
inertia: true
Draggables where momentum gets applied). For a Draggable of
type: "x,y"
,
endX
would pertain to the
x
transform translation, as in the CSS
transform: translateX(...)
. For
type: "top,left"
, the Draggable's
x
would refer to the CSS
left
value that's applied. This is not the global coordinate - it is the inline CSS-related value applied to the element.
