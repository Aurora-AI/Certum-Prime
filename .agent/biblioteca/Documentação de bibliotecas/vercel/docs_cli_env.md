The `vercel env` command is used to manage [Environment Variables](/docs/environment-variables) of a Project, providing functionality to list, add, remove, export, and run commands with environment variables.

To leverage environment variables in local tools (like `next dev` or `gatsby dev`) that want them in a file (like `.env`), run `vercel env pull <file>`. This will export your Project's environment variables to that file. After updating environment variables on Vercel (through the dashboard, `vercel env add`, or `vercel env rm`), you will have to run `vercel env pull <file>` again to get the updated values.

To run a command with environment variables without writing them to a file, use `vercel env run -- <command>`. This fetches the environment variables directly from your linked Vercel project and passes them to the specified command.

### [Exporting Development Environment Variables](#exporting-development-environment-variables)

Some frameworks make use of environment variables during local development through CLI commands like `next dev` or `gatsby dev`. The `vercel env pull` sub-command will export development environment variables to a local `.env` file or a different file of your choice.

terminal

```
vercel env pull [file]
```

To override environment variable values temporarily, use:

terminal

```
MY_ENV_VAR="temporary value" next dev
```

  

If you are using [`vercel build`](/docs/cli/build) or [`vercel dev`](/docs/cli/dev), you should use [`vercel pull`](/docs/cli/pull) instead. Those commands
operate on a local copy of environment variables and Project settings that are
saved under `.vercel/`, which 
`vercel pull` provides.

[Usage](#usage)
---------------

terminal

```
vercel env ls
```

Using the `vercel env` command to list all Environment
Variables in a Vercel Project.

terminal

```

```

Using the `vercel env` command to add an Environment
Variable to a Vercel Project.

terminal

```
vercel env rm
```

Using the `vercel env` command to remove an Environment
Variable from a Vercel Project.

[Extended Usage](#extended-usage)
---------------------------------

terminal

```
vercel env ls [environment]
```

Using the `vercel env` command to list Environment
Variables for a specific Environment in a Vercel Project.

terminal

```
vercel env ls [environment] [gitbranch]
```

Using the `vercel env` command to list Environment
Variables for a specific Environment and Git branch.

terminal

```
vercel env add [name]
```

Using the `vercel env` command to add an Environment
Variable to all Environments to a Vercel Project.

terminal

```
vercel env add [name] [environment]
```

Using the `vercel env` command to add an Environment
Variable for a specific Environment to a Vercel Project.

terminal

```
vercel env add [name] [environment] [gitbranch]
```

Using the `vercel env` command to add an Environment
Variable to a specific Git branch.

terminal

```
vercel env add [name] [environment] < [file]
```

Using the `vercel env` command to add an Environment
Variable to a Vercel Project using a local file's content as the value.

terminal

```
echo [value] | vercel env add [name] [environment]
```

Using the `echo` command to generate the value of the
Environment Variable and piping that value into the 
`vercel dev` command. Warning: this will save the value
in bash history, so this is not recommend for secrets.

terminal

```
vercel env add [name] [environment] [gitbranch] < [file]
```

Using the `vercel env` command to add an Environment
Variable with Git branch to a Vercel Project using a local file's content as
the value.

terminal

```
vercel env rm [name] [environment]
```

Using the `vercel env` command to remove an Environment
Variable from a Vercel Project.

### [Updating Environment Variables](#updating-environment-variables)

The `vercel env update` sub-command updates the value of an existing environment variable.

terminal

```
vercel env update [name]
```

Using `vercel env update` to update an Environment
Variable across all Environments.

terminal

```
vercel env update [name] [environment]
```

Variable for a specific Environment.

terminal

```
vercel env update [name] [environment] [gitbranch]

Variable for a specific Environment and Git branch.

terminal

```
cat ~/.npmrc | vercel env update NPM_RC preview
```

Environment Variables from the cloud and write to a specific file.

terminal

```
vercel env pull --environment=preview
```

"feature-branch" Environment Variables from the cloud and write to the 
`.env.local` file.

### [Running Commands with Environment Variables](#running-commands-with-environment-variables)

The `vercel env run` sub-command runs any command with environment variables from your linked Vercel project, without writing them to a file. This is useful when you want to avoid storing secrets on disk or need a quick way to test with production-like configuration.

terminal

```
vercel env run -- <command>
```

Using `vercel env run` to run a command with
development Environment Variables from your Vercel Project.

terminal

```
vercel env run -- next dev
```

terminal

```
vercel env run -e preview -- npm test
```

Run tests with preview Environment Variables.

terminal

```
vercel env run -e production -- next build
```

Run a production build with production Environment Variables.

terminal

```
vercel env run -e preview --git-branch feature-x -- next dev
```

Run the development server with preview Environment Variables for a specific
Git branch.

The `--` separator is required to distinguish between
flags for `vercel env run` and the command you want to
run. Flags after `--` are passed to your command.

#### [Options](#options)

The following options are available for `vercel env run`:

* `-e, --environment`: Specify the environment to pull variables from. Defaults to `development`. Accepts `development`, `preview`, or `production`.
* `--git-branch`: Specify a Git branch to pull branch-specific Environment Variables.

[Unique Options](#unique-options)
---------------------------------

These are options that only apply to the `vercel env` command.

### [Sensitive](#sensitive)

The `--sensitive` option marks an environment variable as sensitive. Sensitive variables have additional security measures and their values are hidden in the dashboard.

terminal

```
vercel env add API_TOKEN --sensitive
```

`--sensitive` option to add a sensitive Environment
Variable.

terminal

```
vercel env update API_TOKEN --sensitive
```

`--sensitive` option to update a variable and mark it
as sensitive.

### [Force](#force)

The `--force` option overwrites an existing environment variable of the same target without prompting for confirmation.

terminal

```
vercel env add API_TOKEN production --force
```

Using `vercel env add` with the 
`--force` option to overwrite an existing Environment
Variable.

### [Yes](#yes)

The `--yes` option can be used to bypass the confirmation prompt when overwriting an environment file, removing an environment variable, or updating an environment variable.

terminal

```
vercel env pull --yes
```

Using the `vercel env pull` command with the 
`--yes` option to overwrite an existing environment
file.

terminal

```
vercel env rm [name] --yes
