### Frequently Asked Questions

Can I try the Gateway for free?

Yes! When you sign up for a Vercel account, you get $5 of credits every 30 days to try out any model from our model list. We don’t restrict access to premium models.

Note: After you make your first payment, you are considered a paid customer and will no longer receive the free credits.

How is the Gateway priced?

We offer tokens at list price from the upstream providers with no markup.

If you bring your own key, we will not add any markup to your token price (0%).

You are responsible for any payment processing fees.

Do you have any rate limits?

While the upstream providers may have limits, Vercel doesn’t place any rate limits on your queries.

We are constantly working with the upstream providers to get you the maximum limits, throughput and reliability.

What models do you support?

We have over a hundred models from a range of providers to give you the maximum flexibility.
