@SullyOmarr

the @aisdk is probably the best way to build an ai app right now

you can go from idea -> working ai app in 15 mins.

its made working with llms 10x more enjoyable ( and we ship faster)](https://x.com/SullyOmarr/status/1885049394342310335)[![Max Baines's avatar](/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Favatar%2Fmaxbaines.jpg&w=96&q=75&dpl=dpl_34u9oohYr3RxuFq9TLMoLGBY6uAw)

@0xblacklight

Vercel's @aisdk is insanely good. Docs are fantastic. Great abstractions where you want them, doesn't force unnecessary ones, and lets you get under the hood where appropriate. Solves the hard stuff (stream parsing, tool streaming, multi-turn tool execution, error handling and healing/recovery) without forcing you into dumb patterns

It just works, it's fantastic software and delightful to use. The team ships insanely fast, and has turned PRs from me around in like 2 days, and frequently ships requested features in < 1w](https://x.com/0xblacklight/status/1866886257055342787)[![Ryan Carson's avatar](/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Favatar%2Fryancarson.jpg&w=96&q=75&dpl=dpl_34u9oohYr3RxuFq9TLMoLGBY6uAw)

@aisdk has made it possible to just call "generateObject" across any model provider, and it returns a properly typed json object.

it's pure magic.](https://x.com/benhylak/status/1866931335291629995)
