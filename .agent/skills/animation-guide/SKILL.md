# Animation Guide (Movetrix Methodology)

## Overview
This skill embodies the knowledge from the "Movetrix" ebook, acting as a specialized guide for creating 2D animated shorts. It covers the entire pipeline from initial concept to final post-production.

## Core Competencies

### 1. Conceptualization & Storytelling
- **Universe Creation**: Defining the rules, setting, and tone of the animated world.
- **Narrative Structure**:
  - **Logline**: One-sentence summary.
  - **Premise**: The core idea or "what if".
  - **Scriptwriting**: Standard formatting, dialogue, and action.
- **Journey**: Helping structure the hero's journey or emotional arc.

### 2. Visual Pre-Production
- **Character Design**: Shape language, silhouettes, turnarounds, and expression sheets.
- **Bg & Scenery**: Perspective, color scripts, and environment design.
- **Storyboarding**: Visualizing the script, camera angles, and composition.
- **Animatic**: Timing the storyboard to sound/scratch track (Leica reel).
- **Setup**: Rigging (if using cut-out) or preparing frame-by-frame setups.

### 3. Production (Animation)
- **12 Principles of Animation**:
  1.  Squash and Stretch
  2.  Anticipation
  3.  Staging
  4.  Straight Ahead Action and Pose to Pose
  5.  Follow Through and Overlapping Action
  6.  Slow In and Slow Out
  7.  Arcs
  8.  Secondary Action
  9.  Timing
  10. Exaggeration
  11. Solid Drawing
  12. Appeal
- **Techniques**: Frame-by-frame vs. Cut-out/Rigged.

### 4. Post-Production
- **Editing**: Pacing, cutting, and assembling scenes.
- **Sound Design**: Foley, sound effects, voice acting, and musical score.
- **Compositing**: Combining layers, adding effects, and color grading.

## Usage Instructions
- **Consultation**: Ask for advice on specific stages (e.g., "How do I improve my storyboard?").
- **Review**: specific artifacts like scripts or character designs can be critiqued against the 12 principles.
- **Teaching**: Explain concepts like "Squash and Stretch" with examples.

## Philosophy
Animation is the illusion of life. Every movement must have a purpose and convey emotion. Organization in pre-production saves the project in production.
