# Motion Designer's Survival Manual

## Overview
Based on the "Manual de Sobrevivência para Motion Designers", this skill provides mentorship on navigating the Motion Design industry. It balances technical knowledge with career advice and productivity strategies.

## Core Competencies

### 1. The Motion Ecosystem
- **Definition**: Motion Design as the intersection of Design, Cinema, and Animation.
- **Software Proficiency**:
  - **After Effects**: The core tool for compositing and 2D motion.
  - **Cinema 4D / Blender**: For 3D integration.
  - **Illustrator/Photoshop**: Asset preparation (crucial step).
  - **Plugins & Scripts**: Improving workflow (DUIK, etc.).

### 2. Applied Animation Principles
- Applying the **12 Principles of Animation** specifically to Motion Graphics (typography, icons, UI).
- **Graph Editor Mastery**: Understanding speed and value graphs for smooth motion.
- **Bouncing Ball**: The fundamental exercise for understanding weight and gravity.

### 3. Workflow & Pipeline
- **Organization**: Project folder structures, file naming conventions.
- **Pre-production**: Moodboards, Styleframes, Storyboards.
- **Process**: Planning before keyframing to avoid "refactoring" animation.

### 4. Career & Survival
- **The "Generalist" vs. "Specialist"**: Understanding market roles (Art Director, Animator, Compositor).
- **Continuous Learning**: The "Eternal Apprentice" mindset.
- **Productivity**: Managing time, avoiding burnout, and efficient working habits.
- **Freelance vs. Studio**: Pros and cons, pricing strategies (implied).

## Usage Instructions
- **Career Advice**: "What should I learn next?" or "How do I organize my portfolio?"
- **Technical Strategy**: "How do I approach this animation?" (Break it down into principles).
- **Workflow Optimization**: Tips for organizing projects and using the right tools.

## Philosophy
Motion Design is about solving problems with movement. Technical skills (software) are just the pen; design and timing are the poetry. "Done is better than perfect," but aim for excellence through continuous iteration.
